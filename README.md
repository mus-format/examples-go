- dvs - demonstrates how to use [mus-dvs-go](https://github.com/mus-format/mus-dvs-go).
- rest - mus-go + data versioning + REST.
- oneof - shows how you can Marshal/Unmarshal interface (or demonstrates oneof 
  feature).
- pm - contains three examples, two of which demonstrate how to use the `pm` 
  package to serialize graphs and linked lists.
- validation - shows how you can validate different data types during 
  unmarshalling.
